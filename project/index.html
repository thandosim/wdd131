            <p> The Chicken and Spinach program is aimed at heliping families become more self reliant
                by raising indegenius chickens and spinach on their land.
                The families qualify by preparing a sturdy chicken coop and
                tilling the land for spinach. The program then provides them with  spinach 
                seedlings and 10 fully grown indeginous chickens, 8 hens and 2 roosters. In about a 
                month the spinach is ready to begin harvesting. Careful picking of the mature leaves 
                allows the spinach to generate new leaves and continue being harvested for more than 
                a month without needing to be replanted.<br>
                The chickens begin laying eggs almost immediately, laying about 10 eggs on average over 10 days.
                The eggs hatch after 21 days. From the eight hens, around 80 new chickens can be produced which 
                will mature in a few months. They sell for aroung E150.00 and they are also very tasty while being low in fat.<br>
                The families are expected to return 10 chickens at the end of 3 months. These will be used to 
                supply the next group of participating families. </p>

            <p>This program was conceived in early 2024 by Brother Jerom Shongwe of Ezulwini Branch who was the self-reliance specialist
                 at the time. It started with a few families and its success quickly became evident when the families reported that not
                  only are they able to eat some of the harvested spinach, they are also able to sell to their neighbours and use 
                  the money to buy other food items. It wasnt long after some families started reporting that they had too many chickens
                   to feed and they had started to sell some of them.<br>
                This success was noted by Elder Desmond who reported it to the district president and shared it with other branches in the district. 
                He helped organize it and help the other branches implement it. </p>
