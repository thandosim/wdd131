            <p>Hi. My name is Thandokuhle Simelane. I am from Swaziland, which is a small country at the
                southeast part of Africa. I love doing anything on computers, be it playing games, doing
                work or even trying to fix some issues. I am very excited to learn how to develop websites.
                I have lived in Swaziland my whole life except for two years where i was on mission in New Zealand
                serving a mission for The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints. That was the best time of my
                life.
                Since then ive had various callings in the church.
                I am married with one child who is a few months old and i am very excited to watch him grow.
                I want to learn Software development so that i can get a better job and be in a better position to
                provide my family with a better life.
                So far learning web development has been a very exciting experience and i am very happy with my
                progress.
                I am enjoying the course.
            </p>

            <p>Swaziland is a country in the southeast of Africa. It is known for its deep roots in culture and for
                being an absolute mornachy. There are a lot of wild animals including the big 5 and a very beautiful
                landscape.</p>
